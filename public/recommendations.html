						As of now, the model is in it's early stages, so it's not very smart. 
						To overcome this, you can take pictures a certain way to get better readings.

								Check out the <a title="guessmybf" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/guessmybf/">r/guessmybf</a>
								subreddit. The more your pictures resemble those posted in r/gmbf, the easier 
								it is for the model to give you a reading.

								Images in which your torso is encased in a 480x480px area are best.

						</li>
						<li class="recom_item">
							<p>
								For some reason, most people on r/gmbf are clean shaven, tan and take 
								mirror selfies. Mimicking them will let the model make a better prediction.

						<li class="recom_item">
							<p>
								If none of the above work, then ask the folks in r/gmbf to give you a 
								reading and the model will improve over time. (it's a manual process for 
								now, so don't expect too much:p )
