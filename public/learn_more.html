					<h2 class="question">
						Are you saving my pictures?
					</h2>
					<p class="answer">
						No, the inference (the thinking of the AI) is done completely on your device. You can even turn
						off
						your wifi/data after the model is loaded, and select or drag a picture, and you will still be
						able to get a reading! P.S. the only images I get (or want) to see are those posted in the
						subreddit.
					</p>
					<h2 class="question">
						How does this app work?
					</h2>
					<p class="answer">
						Well, all the pictures and body fat estimates came from
						the <a title="guessmybf" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/guessmybf/">r/guessmybf</a> subreddit.
						After that, it was just a matter of repeatedly slamming my head against the keyboard, and
						reading of course.
					</p>
					<h2 class="question">
						Do I need an internet connection to run this app?
					</h2>
					<p class="answer">
						You do, up to the point where the image dropzone tells you to drop or choose a file.
						After that, you don't need any internet connection (but I won't be able to track how many
						detections have been done).
					</p>
					<h2 class="question">
						I feel like the app is not accurate. Why am I getting innacurate readings?!
					</h2>
					<p class="answer">
						Yeah, due to the nature of the <a title="guessmybf"
							href="https://www.reddit.com/r/guessmybf/">r/guessmybf</a> subreddit,
						the model is trained with mostly pictures of male humans who aren't too pale, too tan, or too
						hairy. This also explains why some
						angles may give you more accurate readins than others. <i>(I'm also not an expert at machine
							learning, so sorry.)</i>
					</p>
					<h2 class="question">
						Is there any way to improve the accuracy of the model?
					</h2>
					<p class="answer">
						Yes! Head over to the <a title="guessmybf" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/guessmybf/">r/guessmybf</a>
						subreddit, and post your picture
						or make a comment.
						I still don't have an infrastructure mature enough to automatically improve the app, but the
						more samples (e.g. people posting and commenting on r/guessmybf),
						the better the model should be!,
						the model is trained with mostly pictures of male humans who aren't too pale, too tan, or too
						hairy. This also explains why some
						angles may give you more accurate readins than others. <br>
						Alternatively, try taking a picture from a different angle/distance/lighting or cropping it to a
						square ratio. Check the
						<a href="recommendations">recommendations</a> page for more info.
					</p>
					<h2 class="question">
						So the model isn't 100% accurate. Does this mean it's useless?
					</h2>
					<p class="answer">
						Not really, but I might be biased :p. <br>
						You can compare it to one of those electrical impedance devices. Maybe you're not getting a
						'correct' reading, but if you keep the lighting, distance, angles the same,
						then you will definitely be able to track your progress over time. Let's stay you start at the
						20% - 100% range, but you were actually 17%, then if you dropped 3% body fat,
						then the app would put you in a different body fat percentage range.
